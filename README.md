# Burp Extension

Export all parameter names from a Burp project

The extension adds a context menu handler that when clicked, iterates over all requests in Burp Proxy History, extract all parameters from the request and add them to a unique set of discovered parameters.

# How to

Go to Target Tab, right click on anything (doesn't matter the host), `Extensions->Parameter Names Exporter->Export Parameter Names`. The list is now in your clipboard, but you can also see it in `Extensions -> Click on the extension name -> Output`.
